--------------------------------

Run any website as an regular application, meaning without the browser's
standard tabs, address-bar, etc..
We'll assume you're using Google Chrome, and the entry in the example will be for Twitter.

Create a new file with following content and save it into the folder `~/.local/share/applications`

	#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open
	[Desktop Entry]
	Version=1.0
	Type=Application
	Terminal=false
	Icon[en]=/usr/share/icons/Faenza/apps/96/twitter.png
	Exec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --app=https://twitter.com/
	Name[en]=Twitter
	Name=Twitter
	Icon=/usr/share/icons/Faenza/apps/96/twitter.png
	StartupWMClass=twitter.com

To get `StartupWMClass` use following command, and click on windows for which class you want to find out:

	xprop WM_CLASS
