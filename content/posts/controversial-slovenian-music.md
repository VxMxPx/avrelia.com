## Halo gospodična by Magnifico

Controversy in video and lyrics: homosexuality.

The author describe how a girl, who he refused to have sex with, started a rumor that he's gay (literally _peder_ is _fagot_). He deny rumors, stating that he refused the girl, simply because he's married and needed go home to his family, and in second part of the song, that the dinner was waiting for him plus he had a job the next morning. However, video contradictions his statement, showing him act stereotypically homosexual.

## Laibach

Controversy in video and lyric: (due to misinterpretation!) fascism, totalitarian style.

> Laibach's method is extremely simple, effective and horribly open to misinterpretation. First of all, they absorb the mannerisms of the enemy, adopting all the seductive trappings and symbols of state power, and then they exaggerate everything to the edge of parody... Next they turn their focus to highly charged issues — the West's fear of immigrants from Eastern Europe, the power games of the EU, the analogies between Western democracy and totalitarianism.  _-- Richard Wolfson_

_Note: Laibach aren't really mainstream (in sense that you could turn on the radio and hear them), but are well known in Slovenia (and around the world)._

## Samo Edini by Siddharta

Controversy in video: violence, execution on electric chair.

We're presented with a story of Samo, who's in prison because he murdered Nana (presumingly his girlfriend). While he's waiting to be executed, he's re-living the last moments before the murder. The song's lyrics are in first person, reveling Samo's inner world, as he's stating that _he's the only one, who can calm down her cry, the only one, who doesn't exists, without her world._

The story of both characters, his and her last moments, are presented almost simultaneously to the end. As he's being tied to the electric chair, he see her lying dead on the floor. But moments after that, seconds before the execution, the lyrics state, that _there's more and more hope in this world, as he heard that she wants to live with him, and hence, she'll gave the only life for him_; the electric chair now fires, and we're presented with horrific scene, which is being accomplished with lyrics, which states that _therefore today he breath in, he'll fall asleep today, because tomorrow, he'll wake up with her_.

Finally a child is presented observing two tombstones, with Samo's and Nana's name on them.

The singer describing, how he capture and then torture a man (a man well known, famous for his sins). He explains that he (the singer) has been fooled, and ask people to look away, as now is his turn to sin, and this is his slaughter. At some point he explain, that he feed the man with [strychnine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strychnine), put salt on his wounds, blinded him and finally (supposingly) killed him. It's worth noting that on some point the singer mention that, this (crime) is only his dream.
