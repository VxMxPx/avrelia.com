-----------------

## Stalker

Drama | Sci-Fi, Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1979, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/)

![](/media/movies/stalker.jpg)

A guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.

**I say** deep, poetic, mysterious, philosophical, highly artistic. It might require multiple viewing. It's slow and long (155min) so take your time and watch it with as little disturbances as possibly.

## City Island

Comedy | Drama, Raymond De Felitta, USA, 2009, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174730/)

![](/media/movies/city-island.jpg)

The Rizzos, a family who doesn't share their habits, aspirations, and careers with one another, find their delicate web of lies disturbed by the arrival of a young ex-con (Strait) brought home by Vince (Garcia), the patriarch of the family, who is a corrections officer in real life, and a hopeful actor in private.

**I say** funny, somehow unique, relatively unpredictable, positive. If you liked _Little Miss Sunshine_, you might like this one also.

## Zerkalo

Biography | Drama, Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1975, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072443/)

![](/media/movies/zerkalo.jpg)

A man in his forties is going to die and remembers his past. His childhood, his mother, the war, personal moments but things that also tell the story of all the Russian nation...

> At times something happens and I stop dreaming of the house and the pine trees of my childhood around it. Then I get depressed. And I can't wait to see this dream in which I'll be a child again and feel happy again, because everything will still be ahead, everything will be possible...

**I say** full of dreamy and mysterious sceneries, poetic, artistically made, mysterious as a whole. Deliberately made so that it's confusing. Require multiple viewing. Occasionally dark and depressing.

## Triangle

Mystery | Thriller, Christopher Smith, USA, 2009, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187064/)

![](/media/movies/triangle.jpg)

The story revolves around the passengers of a yachting trip in the Atlantic Ocean who, when struck by mysterious weather conditions, jump to another ship only to experience greater havoc on the open seas.

> Bad dreams make you think you're seeing things that you haven't. You know what I do when I have a bad dream? I close my eyes and I think of something nice - like being here with you.

**I say** decent acting, mysterious mood, relatively unpredictable story, which is unfortunately full of huge holes. There's a lot of meaningless violence and gore which adds nothing to the story and could easily be avoided.

## Soylent Green

Mystery | Sci-Fi | Thriller, Richard Fleischer, USA, 1973, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070723/)

![](/media/movies/soylent-green.jpg)

In an overpopulated futuristic Earth, a New York police detective finds himself marked for murder by government agents when he gets too close to a bizarre state secret involving the origins of a revolutionary and needed new foodstuff.

**I say** the setting is flawed. The acting is mediocre. The message is not very convincing. The conspiracy become obvious quite fast, hence the final _revelation_ is pointless.

## THX 1138

Sci-Fi | Thriller, George Lucas, USA, 1971, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066434/)

![](/media/movies/thx-1138.jpg)

Set in the 25th century, the story centers around a man and a woman who rebel against their rigidly controlled society.

> How shall the new environment be programmed? It all happened so slowly that most men failed to realize that anything had happened at all.

**I say** artistically made, good acting. Interesting setting. Influence of Orwell's _1984_ and Huxley's _Brave New World_ can be felt in this movie. Story and setting are occasionally flawed. Second half is disappointing. End is interesting, but should be extended.

## Gremo mi po svoje

Comedy, Miha Hočevar, Slovenia, 2010, [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630241/)

![](/media/movies/gremo-mi-po-svoje.jpg)

Film is talking about scouts who're camping near Soča river, Triglav National Park in Slovenia. They have strict, easily to be upset scout leader _starešina_ (Jurij Zrnec). While he's already having problems keeping things under control, his work become much more challenging as a group of girls start camp near by.

**I say** couple of funny moments, beautiful scenery, couple of unique characters, but they're not developed enough. The acting is mediocre. Movie is full of mainstream elements, and politically correct statements. The story is shallow and simplistic. Some ideas stays half developed, because the story is too crammed.
