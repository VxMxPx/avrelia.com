We're all familiar with `mv` command for simple renaming or moving of files in bash.

I recently however needed to change extension for multiple files; for such task
one of the easiest commands is `rename`, lets see some examples from the manual:

````bash
rename [options] expression replacement file/filter
````

Given the files foo1, ..., foo9, foo10, ..., foo278, the commands:

````bash
rename foo foo0 foo?
rename foo foo0 foo??
````

will turn them into foo001, ..., foo009, foo010, ..., foo278.  And

````bash
 rename .htm .html *.htm
````

will fix the extension of your html files.

_You should also check `mmv` which can be used for bulk renaming and/or moving._
